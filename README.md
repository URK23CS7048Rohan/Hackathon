Our Project is about AI Powered Memory Aid for Cognitive Impaired
Trying to solve:
1. Routine and Task Monitoring
2. Location Tracking and Navigation Assistance
3. Memory Assistants and Prompts
4. Emergency Detection and SOS Alerts

Core features :
1. This system uses smart, connected devices—such as smartwatches, motion sensors, and smart home devices—to track an individual's daily routine, including activities like wake-up times, meals, and taking medication. The AI plays a key role by analyzing these patterns to learn what a typical day looks like for the user. When the system detects that something is off, such as a missed meal or skipped medication, it sends friendly reminders using audio or visual notifications through speakers or displays. For example, it might say, “It’s time for your medication, Rohan,” or “You haven’t had lunch yet today.
2. his system uses GPS technology or wearable devices to monitor an individual's location, whether they are inside or outside. If the person becomes lost or disoriented, the system provides real-time help. The AI detects when the individual leaves a designated safe zone or shows signs of being lost. In such cases, it can send an alert to a caregiver and offer the individual voice-guided instructions to help them find their way home. For example, the system might say, “Rohan, you’ve walked outside of your usual area. Should I call a family member?”
3. The system acts as a memory aid, letting the individual record important details—such as names, relationships, places, and tasks—using voice commands. The AI helps by recognizing when the user has difficulty remembering something and offers gentle reminders. It can answer questions like, “Who is visiting today?” or “What time is my doctor’s appointment?” by using calendar data and previous interactions. For example, the system might say, “Rohan, your daughter is visiting today at 2 PM. She is bringing your favorite cookies.”
4. The system uses wearable devices and environmental sensors to detect emergencies, such as falls or sudden changes in health indicators like heart rate or body temperature. The AI analyzes this data to determine the seriousness of the situation. If it detects a critical event, like a fall, it automatically contacts caregivers or emergency services. For example, if a fall occurs, the system will send an alert with the individual’s location and health status directly to a caregiver’s phone, ensuring quick assistance.
